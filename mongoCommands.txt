'use strict' - prevents the user from accidentally creating Global variables.
this -> Global -> Window object
this -> inside a declared object = value of the closest parent object
this -> Call, Apply, Bind - Explicit binding - only be used by functions
--- Call, Apply - invokes immediately
--- args are passed as an array in Apply
--- Bind - does not invoke immediately - returns function
---Set timeout is an object on the Window, when this is within a declared object and also Set timeout, it's scope is global.

---New keyword - creates new object

---OOP - A programming model based around the idea of objects.
   Classes -- objects are contructed from.
   JS -- no classes but can mimic the idea using constructor functions
